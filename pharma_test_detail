Create e-precription API for ordering drugs
    
Test task: Building a Django Restframework API
This test task is related to e-prescription module we are currently working on:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_prescribing
    
Note that for you it is just a dummy test task and what you build is not
something we are going to use. so no need for you to understand the exact logic.
Just create a high level logic of what you think such a Django Restframework resource
needs to contain.
    
    
Module:
Imagine we had to create for our service an e-prescription module that allows a 
patient to order drugs from a pharmarcy, 
what will be the main components  of the e-precscription module? which fields would
be needed? what would we need to consider in such a module?
    
Models:
a) User
b) Booking
c) Drugs
c) Pharmacy
    

I want you to create a Django Restframework API that can be used for creating a prescription
for a given user and then sending it to a pharmacy.
We have no pharmacy where you can send this orders. so the task is to just create the orders.
    
This task is not just about coding. It is also about reviewing your ability to understand 
the business logic behind our product on a high level.
